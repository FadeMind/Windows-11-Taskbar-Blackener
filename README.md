How to Make the Windows 11 Taskbar Black (#000000)

This is a simple open source script which changes the system accent and taskbar color to solid black (#000000).
It's an open-source alternative to the "PureDark" executable released by ceofix.net. 

Additionally it works on Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 as well!
